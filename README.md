Provide new output windows which can be filtered so you can debug only section of code you need at one time

Working on a large project with many developers means that everybody does this **Debug.Write(message)**  the the output window is not very useful since you cannot read your messages with all the messages coming in from different sections of the app. This extension provides a new window which reads the output window and then you can filter the output using your own filters.
